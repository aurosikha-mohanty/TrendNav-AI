# TrendNav AI - Social Signal-Driven Product Trend Discovery (Opportunity Scanner) for E-commerce Sellers 


**TrendNav AI** is an AI-powered system designed to help small and mid-sized e-commerce sellers identify emerging product trends early â€” before they gain traction on major marketplaces. By continuously monitoring social media signals (such as Reddit and Amazon), TrendNav AI uncovers high-demand opportunities and highlights areas where sellers can optimize based on inventory availability. Leveraging state-of-the-art NLP and marketplace mapping, the system delivers timely, actionable insights that enable smarter listing strategies, better sourcing decisions, and improved inventory planning.

It aggregates conversations from **Reddit** and **Amazon**, identifies trending products, and assesses customer sentiment. The insights are visualized through an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**. This project runs on **Amazon SageMaker**, ensuring scalable, cloud-based processing and model inference for large datasets.
is an AI-powered system designed to bridge this gap by continuously monitoring social media signals (Reddit, Amazon) and identifying emerging product trends before they gain traction on major marketplaces and identify high opportunity areas based on their inventory availability. 


## Key Features

- Aggregate data from Reddit and Amazon.
- Perform sentiment analysis using **RoBERTa** to classify intent (positive, negative, neutral).
- Extract keywords via **KeyBERT** (MiniLM) for Reddit and **NER** (RoBERTa) for Amazon.
- Group related phrases using **spaCy** and **TF-IDF**.
- Score trends by combining keyword frequency and sentiment.
- Map trends to Amazon inventory using **Sentence-Transformers** and fuzzy matching.
- Visualize insights via a **Streamlit dashboard**.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TrendNav-AI.git
cd TrendNav-AI
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download required NLTK resources:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Aggregation**: Collect Reddit threads and Amazon product data.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify sentiment using **RoBERTa**.
3. **Keyword Extraction**: Use **KeyBERT** (Reddit) and **NER** (Amazon).
4. **Phrase Grouping**: Consolidate related terms with **spaCy** and **TF-IDF**.
5. **Trend Scoring**: Combine keyword frequency and sentiment for scoring.
6. **Marketplace Mapping**: Match trends to inventory via **Sentence-Transformers** and fuzzy matching.
7. **Visualization**: View trends and insights on a **Streamlit dashboard**.

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
Access through link : https://trend-navai-app-demo.streamlit.app/
or 
use the below code:
```bash
streamlit run treamlit-nav-dash.py
```

Explore trending products, sentiment insights, and inventory mappings interactively through the dashboard.
